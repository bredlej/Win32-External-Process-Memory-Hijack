# Win32-External-Process-Memory-Hijack
Manipulation of memory belonging to another process (Win32)

The project contains two folders:
- ProcHost.exe: simple program which has a string and each second displays it to stdout.
- ProcClient.exe: accesses the memory of ProcHost.exe and replaces the string with a text input of the user.
